Cost function:
new node cost:
Closeness to previously set path
How far we've branched out (weighting unexplored paths vs explored paths to a depth)
Variance of node's pollution
distance penalty = e^((dx-previouspath length)/scale)

add to previous node cost
divide by all nodes

define a class for taking data. Sets up files and takes in an environment. Updates this environment.
Can either treat this as a dictionary which then updates the environment with a function call, or update it as it goes.

Traffic works by updating traffic live, so maybe we can realtime process pollution data back into env as it is called each loop when it updates traffic.

Make pollution data across edges? This would be used by the cost function for the cost of going across an edge.

Graph clustering for path planning.

Sum (lambda * variance_i + (1-lambda)*particle_count_estimate_i)
